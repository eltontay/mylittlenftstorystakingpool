# mylittlenftstorystakingpool

[STORY] is my first staking pool that made me lose 500 ada ... due to the lack of my due dilligence.
It also taught me a lot about coding on the Cardano Blockchain because I digested every line of code that went into building a staking pool.
I accidentally overrode one of my keys which made me lose access to this staking pool.
Nonetheless, it was a painful experience but a good one.
I created my second staking pool [MLNS] with a much more focused and meticulous mindset.
It is running beautifully and I am very proud of my achievement.
